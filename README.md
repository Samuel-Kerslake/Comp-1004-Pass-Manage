This is my project for comp 1004. it is a password manager that will allow the user to, after signing in, save passwords and usernames and then retrieve passwords depending the username provided. it also comes with an
area that allow the user the create a password and it checks to make sure that it contains a few basic things like capitals numbers and hasa minimum length so that any password created using it will have a base level of security. as a while its quite a basic spa due to the fact that coding isnt my strong suit and i wanted to focus more time towards my report because im hoping that i get the points i need from this.
